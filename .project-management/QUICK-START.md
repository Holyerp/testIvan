## 🆕 Brand New Project

### Step 1: Copy Files
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
cp -r /path/to/claude_repo/.project-management .
cp -r /path/to/claude_repo/.claude .
cp /path/to/claude_repo/.CLAUDE.MD .
```

### Step 2: Define Your Project
Fill one file: `.project-management/input/scope.md`

Minimum info needed:
- What you're building (project name + description)
- Main features (bullet list)
- Target users (who will use it)

### Step 3: Initialize
```bash
/init-project
```

Choose options:
- Tech stack: **[1] Default** (recommended for web apps)
- i18n: **[2] No** (unless you need multi-language)

**Result:** System creates everything automatically!
- ✅ Modular backlog (organized by phase)
- ✅ Technical spec
- ✅ Phase plans
- ✅ Progress tracking files
- ✅ DASHBOARD.md (live status view)

### Step 4: Start Development
```bash
/execute-work phase 1
```

Choose mode:
- **[1] Continuous** - runs all stories automatically
- **[2] Paused** - waits for approval after each story

Approve plan: **[Yes]**

**Done!** Claude now:
- ✅ Implements stories
- ✅ Runs tests automatically
- ✅ Creates git commits (no AI credits)
- ✅ Updates progress automatically

### Step 5: Check Progress Anytime
```bash
open .project-management/output/progress/DASHBOARD.md
```

**No commands needed!** File auto-updates as you work.

## 🔄 Existing Project

### You have old backlog.md?

**One command to upgrade:**
```bash
/migrate-to-modular
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Splits backlog.md into phase files
- ✅ Creates DASHBOARD.md (live view)
- ✅ Creates progress tracking files
- ✅ Backs up original files
- ✅ Ready in 2-5 minutes

**Then continue:**
```bash
# Check current status
open .project-management/output/progress/DASHBOARD.md

# Continue development
/execute-work phase 2    # or wherever you left off
```
